**Overview**

Resilient Community is a board game-to-PC/mobile port. The board game was originally developed by Prof. Eun Cha & Abby Beck to teach students electric infrastructure decision-making skills. The Stu/dio is bringing access to the educational experience to digital platforms, where the game will increase its reach and access to current and future generations of students.

The project was developed under The Stu/dio, a student led work-for-hire game development studio affiliated with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sponsors: Eun Jeong Cha, Luc Paquette, Eric Shaffer, UIUC Computer Science and Civil & Environmental Engineering.

**Contributions**

**QA Feedback and Updates**

* Bug Recution and Gameplay Improvements:
    * Improved the Turn count system by clearly defining 1 system across the main game loop. This removed bugs that would trigger turn-specific cutscenes on the wrong turns.
    * Renamed neighborhoods to match colors, as opposed to an arbitrary "income level" to increase player understanding og in-game locations and dialogue.
    * Collaborated with Sponsors to determine specific in-game terminology to remove term ambiguity across the game and code base.
