Hello! I'm Game Developer and I love making and playing games!

I've worked on shipped titles like VRchaeology and Resilient Community that both come from [The Stu/dio](https://games.illinois.edu) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I've also worked on small games as class projects or personal projects.
I've collaborated with other programmers and multi-disciplinary teams like design, art, and management for these projects to come to life.

My specialization is in Unreal Engine 5 and Godot with experience designing technical design documents; building gameplay systems in VR, 3D and 2D; and creating data-collection pipelines for a smooth QA process.
Throughout these projects I primarily implemented gameplay, refactored the code base, optimized builds, and improved user experience.

If you're interested in what I can offer your company, please contact me!
