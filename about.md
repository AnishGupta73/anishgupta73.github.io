Hello! I'm Game Developer and I love making and playing games!

I've worked on shipped titles like VRchaeology and Resilient Community that both come from The Stu/dio at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I've also worked on small games as class projects and personal projects.
I've collaborated with other programmers and multi-disciplinary teams like design, art, and management for these projects to come to life.

My specialization is in Unreal Engine 5 and Godot 4 with experience designing technical design documents; building gameplay systems in VR, 3D, and 2D; and creating data-collection pipelines for a smooth QA process.
Throughout these projects I primarily implemented gameplay features, refactored the code base, optimized builds, and improved user experience. 

Some of my favorite series are JRPGs like Xenoblade, Octopath, Trails, Atelier, etc. and multiplayer Games like Smash Bros, Overcooked, Towerfall, etc.

If you're interested in what I can offer, please contact me!
