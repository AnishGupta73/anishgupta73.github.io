Hello! I'm Anish, a Computer Science Masters graduate, with a Mathemtatics Bachelors, pursuing a career as a software engineer within the game industy. I'm interested in developing gameplay features and the problems I'm interested in solving are "how can we turn a high-level design into low-level code that is both scalable and maintainable?", and "how can we craft the best experience for the players?". I have 2+ years of experience in UE5/Godot 4, specializing in designing technical design documents; building gameplay systems in VR; and creating data-collection pipelines for a smooth QA process.

Some of my favorite series are JRPGs like Xenoblade, Octopath, Trails, Atelier, and multiplayer Games like Smash Bros, Overcooked, and Towerfall.

If you're interested in what I can offer, please contact me!
