Hello! I'm Anish, a Computer Science Masters graduate, with a Mathematics Bachelors, pursuing a career as a software engineer within the game industy. I have 2+ years of experience in UE5/Godot 4, specializing in designing technical design documents; building gameplay systems in VR; and creating data-collection pipelines for a smooth QA process. I am interested in translating a high-level design idea into a system that is both scalable and maintainable.

In everything that I work on, I try to ask "how can we craft the best experience for the players?"

I'm drawn to the unique narrative experience that games can offer like Xenoblade Chronicles, The Trails series, and Expedition 33. I also enjoy the social experiences that games can offer through multiplayer games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Overcooked, and Towerfall.

If you're interested in what I can offer, please contact me!
